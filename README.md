My solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 puzzles (better late than never!)

https://adventofcode.com/2019

Solutions are written in Kotlin this year, to spice things up. You can run all tests (i.e. solve all puzzles) by running

`./gradlew test`

You can run individual tests with

`./gradlew test --tests "*day X, part Y*"`
